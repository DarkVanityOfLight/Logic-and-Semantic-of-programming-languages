# Logic and Semantics of Programming languages

In this repository I will try to formalize most of the proofs from my Logic and Semantics course in University at RPTU.

Each week a new assignment is given which may or may not depend on each other.


## Usage of Lia and other auto solvers

Since this is supposed to teach me how to use Coq I try to avoid using lia, auto, omega and what not.
But when I use these tactics there could be several reasons for it:

- The theorem/lemma which is to proof should be in the standard lib and I cannot find it or there is some other way unkown to me.
- The theorem/lemma which is to proof is to hard for me and I don't understand how to solve it.
- In generall I will use it when I don't see another way to solve this and it is not a major theorem.
